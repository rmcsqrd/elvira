## NODE CHEATSHEET

There are several nodes in this catkin workspace, only edit the ones in the "editable" list (or stuff will break).

### Editable Nodes

- __circledraw__  
This node is really more of a "hello world" program to verify that opencv is working.

- __blob_detect__
This node is the primary node that I'm doing Elvira's image detection with.

### "Don't Touch" Nodes

- ddynamic_reconfigure
- image_common
- realsense-ros
